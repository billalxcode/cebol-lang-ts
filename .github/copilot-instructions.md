# Commit Message Guidelines
- Follow the Conventional Commits style for commit messages. Use the following types where applicable: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore.
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters and the body to 72 characters per line.
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature" or "Adds feature").
- Use lowercase for the type (e.g., "feat", "fix").
- Use lowercase for the scope unless it is a proper noun (e.g., "feat(parser): add new parsing algorithm").
- Use lowercase for the description (e.g., "add support for new syntax").
- Separate the subject from the body with a blank line.
- In the body, explain the what, why, and how of the changes. Provide context for the change.
